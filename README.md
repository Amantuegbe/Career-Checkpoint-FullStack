Career Checkpoint – Full Stack Developer Journey
Introduction
This document marks a significant checkpoint in my transition into the field of Full Stack Web Development. After completing a structured training program at GomyCode in full stack Web Development. I am reflecting on the skills I’ve gained and my readiness for the next phase of my career.
How Ready Am I for the Next Step?
I feel confident and ready to apply what I’ve learned in real-world projects or professional roles. The skills I have gained are practical and in demand. I have built several hands-on projects that reflect the core principles of full stack development, including:
- Authentication (JWT & bcrypt)
- RESTful API design
- React component structuring and state management
- Secure database operations using MongoDB
- Deployment using platforms like Vercel, Render, and GitHub
This journey has not only improved my technical skills but has also made me more confident in collaborative development, version control, and deploying applications online.
